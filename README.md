# Bazel rules for .Net

This ruleset is a alternative to using MSBuild with [.Net](https://dot.net)
By using this ruleset instead of MSBuild you gain the Bazel promise of `{Fast, Correct} - Choose two`

This document will not enumerate all the possible gains that Bazel can bring and instead
it's recommended to take a look at the [Bazel documentation](https://bazel.build/) for a
primer on Bazel.

## Usage

See the documentation in the [docs](docs/)

See examples in the [examples](examples/) folder.
